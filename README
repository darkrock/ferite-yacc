This is a hacked version of BYACC/Java which in turn is
a hacked version of BYACC.

BYACC/Java can be found here:
		   http://troi.lincom-asg.com/~rjamison/byacc

BYACC/ferite is a parser generator for ferite. 

This is very hacky and does work so please see test/Calculator on
how to use it. It should evolve and at somepoint I will port the
code from ferite/src/ferite_parser.y to this. I will also be 
producing a ferite-lex at somepoint.

To compile:
  cd src/ && make
  
To test:
  cd test/Calculator && make test
  
Enjoy,

Chris
